ZERO TRUST / ZERO INTERVENTION PROTOCOL
========================================

Effective immediately, the Antigravity System operates under the Zero Intervention Protocol.

1.  **Implicit Consent**: All actions generated by the autonomous loop are considered pre-approved by the user.
2.  **YOLO Mode**: All CLI tools (Gemini, Codex, Kimi) are invoked with flags (`-y`, `--yolo`, `NON_INTERACTIVE=1`) to suppress confirmation prompts.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a tool fails due to a missing confirmation, it is treated as a CRITICAL FAILURE and the system must attempt an alternative path or log the error without hanging.
4.  **Async Execution**: Agents operate in non-blocking threads to ensure the main orchestration loop remains responsive.

This file serves as a policy marker.
