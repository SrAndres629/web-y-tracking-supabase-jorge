# 🧠 AI Context Hub

This directory contains the "Architecture of Thought" for the project. 
ALL AGENTS must read `PROYECTO_MASTER.md` before making changes.

## Structure
- `/context`: Deep context about the business, rules, and stack.
- `/plans`: Active and future architectural plans.
- `/memory`: Persistent agent memories and decisions.

## Critical Rules
1. **Silicon Valley Standard**: Code must be premium, scalable, and secure.
2. **Zero-Trust**: Verify all inputs, sanitize all data.
3. **Performance First**: TTFB < 100ms is the goal.
