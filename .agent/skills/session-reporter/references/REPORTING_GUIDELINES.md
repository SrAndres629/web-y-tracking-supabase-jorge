# Guidelines for Professional Session Reports

## 📝 Tone & Brand
- Ensure the tone reflects the **"Elite Digital" / "Quiet Luxury"** standard of Jorge Aguirre Flores.
- Do not use generic, overly verbose language.
- Structure sentences to highlight strategic problem-solving.

## 🗄️ Format Requirements
- **Frontmatter (YAML)**: Must contain an accurate creation `date`, an impactful `title`, a brief `description`, and appropriate `tags`.
- **Markdown (MD)**: The core content. Bullet points and bold text should be used to improve readability. Break sections up by themes (e.g., "Agentic Architecture vs Software").
- **JSON Structure**: The bottom of the markdown file should contain a valid JSON block summarizing key `records` of actionable learnings and code implementations.

## 🧠 Agentic vs Actionable Learnings
- Focus on documenting **Agentic Workarounds** (e.g., changes to skills, OODA loops, prompt adjustments).
- Document **Architectural Engineering** decisions (e.g., routing changes in FastAPI, Edge Tracking).
- Explain *why* the task was transcendental, avoiding mundane tasks (like correcting typos).
